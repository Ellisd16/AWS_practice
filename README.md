 ![aws_img](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70980600/113953559-f2596700-97cc-11eb-8d6f-7eab1769816b.png)

## About

This was a practice application I developed to help familiarize myself with the AWS framework and serval services it offers. The application allows for users to store an image into a S3Bucket that they create in the terminal, and displays every image within the bucket on the page.  

## Languages and Programs
* Languages
  * Javascipt
  * React

* AWS Services
  * S3 Bucket
  * IAM
  * AWS Amplify
  * Cognito
  * Key Managment Service
  
## Installation

Download the code for this repo through Github!

cd into the file location and enter "npm start" into the terminal!

## Challenges

Learning how to navigate through the various services was a bit challenging, but with the right turtorials and some help, I was able to get the page running!

## Further Plans

I plan on creating a server so that I can run this page outside of local host and maybe styling it up a little more can help!
